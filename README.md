# Handwritten Digits Prediction

## Project Overview

The **Handwritten Digits Prediction** project uses a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits from images. This project employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with convolutional layers, allowing it to learn the unique features of each digit. Built using TensorFlow, this model can accurately predict digits from the widely used MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of labeled images of handwritten numbers.

## Libraries Used

- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the deep learning model.
  - **Sequential**: For structuring the neural network layers in a sequential order.
  - **Layers (Dense, Flatten, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D)**: For building the neural network architecture with convolutional and dense layers.
- **NumPy**: For handling and manipulating data in numerical arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing sample images and model predictions.

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation**:
  - Loads and preprocesses images of handwritten digits.
  - Normalizes pixel values to improve model performance.

- **Model Architecture**:
  - **Convolutional Layers**: For feature extraction from images.
  - **Flattening and Dense Layers**: For classification based on learned features.
  - Uses **MaxPooling** to reduce feature map size, making the model efficient.

- **Model Training and Evaluation**:
  - Trains the model on a large dataset of labeled images.
  - Evaluates the modelâ€™s accuracy and loss on a test set to measure performance.

- **Prediction and Visualization**:
  - Predicts digits on new images.
  - Visualizes predictions alongside actual images to demonstrate model performance.



## Usage

1. **Prepare the Data**: Load the MNIST dataset or any other dataset of handwritten digits.
2. **Train the Model**: Train the neural network on the dataset.
3. **Make Predictions**: Use the model to predict digits in new images.
4. **Visualize Results**: Use Matplotlib to view sample predictions.
